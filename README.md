### A ML model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. 
This model could be used in a recommendation system , to recommend texts (for example, recent news articles)
that are appropriate for someone’s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is
inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won’t be able to understand it.

## Context 
We develop this model as a project for Big-Sclae Analytics course.
It's purpose is to develop a NLP model from scratch, learn and understand the related concepts.


## Methodology
1. Define adequately our problem and thhink how to model it:

  - Do some search on the topic 
  - Find and read related articles 
  - find out how to solve the problem : Classification,Regression ...
  
2. Gather Data
3. Build the model
4. Evaluate How good the model is 

## Milestone 1
### 1 Problem 
We will model the problem as a multi-label classification problem. We may consider several features (as proposed in the papers below):
- Part-of-speech (POS) tags
- Number of words
- Number of different words
- Words frequencies
- Number of different verbs forms
- Number of auxiliary verbs
- Number of main verbs
- Cognativity  
- ....
