### A ML model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. 
This model could be used in a recommendation system , to recommend texts (for example, recent news articles)
that are appropriate for someone’s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is
inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won’t be able to understand it.
